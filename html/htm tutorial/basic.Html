    <p>
      Nature is wonderful. It has pretty landscapes and many different living
      things. The colors, shapes, and sounds in nature are amazing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine a sunset. The sky turns warm colors like orange and purple. Or a
      quiet lake shows the green things around it. Nature is like a giant
      painting.
    </p>

      alt="Sunset over mountains"
      style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto"
    />
    <p>
      Even small things in nature, like the designs on a flower or the big
      shapes of mountains, are like art. Everything, big or small, works
      together to make nature beautiful.
    </p>

    <p>
      And have you heard the sounds of nature? Leaves make noise, water flows,
      birds sing - it's like a calm music that makes you feel peaceful inside.
    </p>

      alt="Close-up of a colorful flower"
      style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto"
    />

    <p>
      Nature is like a big team where everyone has a job. It's all connected. If
      we take care of nature, like forests and coral reefs, we're also taking
      care of ourselves and the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      In simple words, nature is inspiring and makes us feel calm and amazed.
      HTML helps us talk about it online, but the real magic is in the beauty of
      the natural world that makes us happy inside.
